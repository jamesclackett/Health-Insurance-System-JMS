# Once dockerized, services all connect through a common docker network 'mynet'
# For each container, docker sets the local network hostname to [container name]
# SO, each java quotation module and the broker connects to tcp.activemq
# the activemq container is port mapped to host machine (61616:61616)
# This makes it possible for a client on the host machine to connect to the system.

# In docker-compose.yml, I have used the 'depends on' key to ensure services are set
# up in a logical order. However this may not be strictly necessary, my aim was to avoid any
# unanticipated bugs.
